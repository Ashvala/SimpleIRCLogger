SimpleIRC
===============
In Part 2 of my stupid simple series of things, we have an IRC client!

This IRC Client is a little(too) buggy in its current incarnation, but, it should give you a decent idea as to how to proceed forward with building one if you choose to. 

Instructions
===============


``` python client.py ```

enter your nick, the irc host, port and a channel. 


Challenges for people who go through this code:
================

- Get PING PONG up and running

- Try and learn how to do threading on this! 

- Use this to learn curses as a library? 

- When I exit the logger, store the file in the following format: "SIMPLEIRC-datemonthyear.txt"
